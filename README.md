# The-2018-Winter-Olympics-medal-prediction-for-the-host-country

Data Source: 1896 to 2016 Olympics Game data https://www.kaggle.com/code/saduman/data-analysis-from-olympic-history-data/data and https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sayantanmitra1/olympic-dataset-for-eda?select=noc_regions.csv

In this project, we will be trying to predict the performance of South Korean athletes at the 2018 Games using a variety of individual characteristics, as well as the Host Country Effect.

The Host Country Effect is a phenomena whereby the host country's athletes will perform better at their own country as compared to competing overseas. This may be attributed to factors such as having more supporters or familarity with the competition venue. In this case study, we will be investigating if being the host country affects the country's performance at the Olympics.

After establishing the validity of the Host Country Effect, we will then investigate into the probability of South Korean athletes winning a medal in the 2018 Games based on the following factors.

We will be using the following factors to predict the probability: Age, Height, Weight, Sex, Year, Sport, Team and Host Country Effect.

Using this information, we will try to predict how Team South Korea did in the 2018 Pyeongchang Games.
